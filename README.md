# Small-math-bot
A little telegram bot done with Graddle to learn how to use this tecnology

## Goals
I made this little bot just to understand how a telegram bot can work using Java. This isn't a life changing bot but it's interesing at least

## To-dos
1. Make it work as an inline bot (in Telegram, an inline bot is one that you can call from any conversation, like @youtube or @gif)
2. Make my own String-to-math-to-string method, instead of using a Javascript engine
